# Start PlatformIO Project

## Description

**Single source code. Multiple platforms.**

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) allows developer to compile the same code with different development platforms using the Only One Command platformio run. This happens due to Project Configuration File (platformio.ini) where you can setup different environments with specific options (platform type, firmware uploading settings, pre-built framework, build flags and many more).
